# Centering Things

This is one of the first things you usually look to do as you are styling a new website.
Centering Divs and other things.

There are a couple different ways I like to do this, and there are pitfalls that can be watched out for.

Ways to center divs:

1. Give it a width, and give it left/right margins auto, and voila
2. Give it a display block, and left/right margins auto (so long as you are centering nested divs/imgs)




Pitfalls to watch out for:
- Browser needs to know how large your item is in your page, then it can render it centered based on its window size
-
