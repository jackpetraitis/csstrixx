# Stripes

 We can add stripes by using gradient.
I got this from the following link:
[CSS Tricks.com example](https://css-tricks.com/stripes-css/)


There is the repeating linear gradient way of doing stripes, you can do it in background property. The better supported way of doing stripes is by just doing it in linear-gradient in the background proerty. Better old browser support according to css-tricks.
